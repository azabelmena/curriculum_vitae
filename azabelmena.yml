          Conducted assessments to identify the educational needs of my students and
          developed individualized learning plans.

          Tasked with providing tutoring services to seven high school students for
          10 hours a week in the subjects of Algebra and Pre-Calculus.

          Evaluated students learning styles and provided appropriate techniques
          for maximizing understanding and minimizing frustration.

          Simplified math concepts while coaching students to think critically
          when problem solving; eventually introducing them to axiomatic systems
          within mathematics.

          Provided tutoring one-on-one to five highschool students in the subjects
          of Algebra, Pre-Calculus, and Geometry for two times a week, at two hours
          for each session.
